# Smart-Guard

As being part of society, people have different challenges to overcome which could be as large as saving
our self from vulnerable activities. Many surveys suggest that the number of crimes across the globe is
increasing exponentially. The ratio between several crimes and culprit prisoned is very large which itself
says about the lack of technological advancements in finding the offender. After going through series of
different topics, surveys, journals, and research papers, the idea was proposed with a practical solution
that can potentially reduce the risk of damage caused during the time of the incident and help us find the
culprit without letting him/her escape.
